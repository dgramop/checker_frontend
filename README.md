# Checker Frontend

React project for the MIX check-in application

Use `yarn build --release` to build a release. Use `yarn start` to start the project for local development.

Run the backend at port 8000 when locally developing. Run the backend at port 8001 when in production, and configure nginx as a reverse proxy. 

Currently, the goal is to keep this application as minimal as possible to reduce maintanance overhead. Do not add feature unless they are absolutely necessary.
